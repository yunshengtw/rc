#!/bin/bash

# Unbind everything and rebind S-N to binding. Note that the line below unbinds
# all global key patterns, but keep the non-global ones. If we ever want to
# unbind all non-global ones as well, have the following:
#
# unbind-key -a
#
unbind-key -a -n
bind-key -n \uF000 source-file ~/.tmux.bind
